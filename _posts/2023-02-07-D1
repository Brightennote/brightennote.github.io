# Diary 1, Sunny
Today, I wanted to get up at 7 am, but I couldn't. Because I had stomach ache at dawn. I woke up at 3 am and went to toilet. but I couldn't poo or something. after that, I just got back to bed and had a sleep. So when I woke up at 7 am, since the alarm, I decided to sleep again an hour more.
What do I have to do to get up at 7 am? I try to go to bed at 12 am. But there is many attractive things. Like game, Youtube, webtoons or others. So I have to decide whether go to bed earlier or not. Just do it after thinking. That is what I need to do now.
And I went to work, and just spend time for nothing. When I have no work, I just spend time to read english articles or talk with co-workers or search on my phone. If I want to do something, I could. But there is no any firm decision to do something. Let's think about what I can do during weekdays (during and after work)
One of my goal of new year is getting the CCNP. This is kind of 'network' certification. If I got this certif, I will apply to another job like Data center technician. When I think about that, it makes me feel exciting cause one of my dream is controlling some network devices. And also I want to learn about the coding. I tried to learn about the HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make my own website. When I learned it, it was exciting but quite hard. I feel like it was good for hobby, not for a job. So I will learn it for the hobby... haha..
This is my first time to write down my thinking on the board. So the story is not much smooth I guess. I'm just writing down following my stream of consciousness. But, I guess, it is good to improve my english. I can use the word or sentence what I learned. I really hope I can do it every day for my life.
**Brighten, Just do what you are thinking. It will make a new flow in your life!!**
